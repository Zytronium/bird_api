BIRD API is the government's secret remote API for their spy drones disguised
as a flying animal called a "bird." The Bird can detect threats to democracy
and send a signal to an orbiting satellite through this API, which then fires
an orbital space laser directly at the threat's home. The API can also be used
to send signals activating panic mode, which self-destructs the drone.
